# GA4 Setup Project

This project demonstrates how to set up Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and track a custom event on a website.

## Steps to Set Up GA4

1. **Create a GA4 Property**:
   - Sign in to Google Analytics and create a new GA4 property.
   - Set up a data stream and get your Measurement ID.

2. **Add GA4 Tracking Code**:
   - Insert the GA4 Global Site Tag (gtag.js) into the `<head>` section of your website.

3. **Track a Custom Event**:
   - Add event tracking code to your website to track custom events (e.g., a "Sign Up" button click).

4. **Verify Your Setup**:
   - Use the Developer Tools and GA4 real-time reports to verify that your event tracking is working.
